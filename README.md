# Verifiable-Coherent-NLU
Shared repository for TRIP dataset for verifiable NLU and coherence measurement for text classifiers. Covers the following upcoming publications in Findings of EMNLP 2021:
1. Shane Storks, Qiaozi Gao, Yichi Zhang, and Joyce Chai. (2021). [Tiered Reasoning for Intuitive Physics: Toward Verifiable Commonsense Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04947). In _Findings of EMNLP 2021_.
2. Shane Storks and Joyce Chai. (2021). [Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg: Assessing Coherence of Text Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04922). In _Findings of EMNLP 2021_.
